### a basic asset setup for dev && prod with gulp, foundation, bourbon, fontawesome, etc. working even with IE8

## Getting Started

To use the code [download it](https://github.com/herrkessler/gulp-foundation/archive/master.zip), or clone it:

A number of other task aliases are available, such as:
